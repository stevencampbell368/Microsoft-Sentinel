<h1>Microsoft Sentinel: Authentication Logins & Threat Detection</h1>

 </h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
During my Cybersecurity internship at LOG(N) Pacific, I am leveraging the authentication logs within our environment, which are generated by other interns and some threat actors on the internet. In this project, I am creating world map visualisation workbooks in Microsoft Sentinel, based on originating IP addresses. These visualisations provide a clear overview of network activity for various scenarios, such as successful logins, failed authentication attempts, and unusual login patterns. This experience is allowing me to further enhance my KQL skills, refining queries to extract valuable insights and strengthen security monitoring within Microsoft Sentinel.

<p>The following workbooks were created to analyse and monitor different authentication scenarios effectively.
<br />


<h2>Use Case: Establishing a Baseline for Successful Logins</h2>

<b>Scenario:</b> As a Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst, I wanted to establish a baseline for normal login activity across the organisation by identifying successful authentication logins. This is crucial for detecting anomalies that may indicate compromised accounts or policy violations. By monitoring successful logins, I can identify changes in login patterns and ensure employees are accessing systems from expected locations using valid credentials.

The aim is to detect abnormal behaviours, such as logins from unexpected locations or devices, which could signal potential security risks. This baseline also supports proactive measures, like flagging unusual login patterns for further investigation.

<b>Query Breakdown:</b> 

This query is designed to analyse successful login events, providing insights into user login activity based on location and frequency.

</p>

- <b>SigninLogs:</b> This is where all login activity is stored, including details of each login attempt.
- <b>Where ResultType == 0:</b> This filters the data to show only successful logins, as ResultType == 0 indicates a successful login.
- <b>Summarize LoginCount = count():</b> Counts the number of successful logins for each user, grouped by their login location (e.g., city, country).
- <b>Project:</b> The project operator is used to select and display specific columns from the query results, (e.g., Identity, Latitude, Longitude, City, Country, and LoginCount for each login event.
<br />



<h2>Use Case: Identifying Unsuccessful Authentication Logins</h2>

<b>Scenario:</b> I wanted to track unsuccessful authentication logins across the organisation to help identify potential security threats, such as brute force attacks or compromised credentials. Monitoring these failed logins is important to detect unusual activity early, allowing for timely investigation and prevention of unauthorised access.

By tracking patterns of failed logins, this query helps the organisation stay proactive in securing sensitive data and maintaining overall security.

</p>

- <b>SigninLogs:</b> This is where all login activity is stored, including both successful and unsuccessful login attempts.
- <b>Where ResultType != 0:</b>  Filters the data to show only unsuccessful logins, as any result other than 0 indicates a failed login attempt.
- <b>Summarize LoginCount = count():</b> Counts the number of failed login attempts for each user, grouped by their login location (e.g., city, country).
- <b>Project:</b> The project operator selects and displays specific columns from the query results (e.g., Identity, Latitude, Longitude, City, Country, and LoginCount for each failed login event).

<h2>Use Case: Identifying Unauthorised Login Attempts Outside Gloucester and London Offices</h2>

<b>Scenario:</b> A cybersecurity consulting firm and cyber managed services provider based in Gloucester, UK, with an additional office in London, UK, enforces a strict on-site work policy due to the sensitive nature of client data and UK cybersecurity regulations. Remote work is strictly prohibited to prevent data leaks, unauthorised access, or compliance violations. By detecting logins from unexpected locations, the firm can ensure that only authorised users access company systems, preventing potential policy violations and security risks.

The goal is to flag any login attempts that originate from outside the designated office locations, helping to enforce the company’s on-site work policy and mitigate any risk of remote or unauthorised access.

<br />

- <b>SigninLogs:</b> This table stores all login activity, including both successful and unsuccessful login attempts.
- <b>Where ResultType == 0:</b> Filters the data to include only successful logins, focusing on valid login events.
- <b>Extend City = tostring(LocationDetails["city"]):</b> Creates a new column to extract the city from the login location details.
- <b>Where City !in ("London", "Gloucester"):</b> Excludes logins from London and Gloucester, identifying logins from any other locations.
- <b>Summarize LoginCount = count():</b> Counts the number of successful logins from unauthorised locations.
- <b>Project:</b> The project operator selects and displays specific columns (e.g., Identity, Latitude, Longitude, City, Country, and LoginCount for each login event from unauthorised locations).
<br />



<h2>Use Case: Identifying High-Risk Failed Authentication Attempts</h2>

<b>Scenario:</b> In a cybersecurity consulting and managed services firm, monitoring failed authentication attempts is vital for detecting potential security threats like brute force attacks or credential stuffing. Identifying users with more than five failed logins helps spot suspicious activity early and take preventative measures.

- <b>Project:</b> The project operator selects and displays specific columns from the query results, such as Identity (user), Latitude, Longitude, City, Country, and LoginCount.
<br />


By creating these use cases and scenarios, I successfully developed a comprehensive set of world map visualisation workbooks using Microsoft Sentinel, which allows for the visualisation of authentication events, including successful logins, failed attempts, and abnormal login patterns. This enhances my ability to monitor and respond to network activity effectively. Additionally, I’ve added KQL to my query toolbelt, enabling me to explore and experiment with different aspects of the data to improve security monitoring and analysis.
